Storage class (기억 클래스)

1. auto storage class
    default storage class.
    It is local variables and only exists within the block in which it is declared.
    auto keyword is omitted usually.
    ```
    int a = 10;
    auto int b = 20;
    ```

2. static storage class
    One of the global variables.
    If a static variable is not initialized, it is automatically initialized to zero.
    It occupies memory in the lifetime of the program.


3. extern storage class
    It is also a global variable.
    It is used to give a reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program files.

    When there are multiple files,
        and you define a global variable or function,
        which will also be used in other files,
        then extern will be used in another file to give reference of defined variable or function.


4. register storage class
    It is used to define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM.
    It makes the access to the variable faster.
    Usually, it is used for "for loop counter" variables.
